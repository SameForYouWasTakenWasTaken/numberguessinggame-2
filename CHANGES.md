# 11TH NOVEMBER 2024
**ADDED:**
- Added a range that you could add, without having to manually change it in the code (if you had tried it that way)
- Made the code more "automatic" than manual (makes my job easier)
- Added security points, making sure you don't try to type characters or negative numbers (negative numbers make no sense, you just lose lol)
